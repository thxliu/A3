What Went Well: I felt that as I implemented more methods, I had a much better understanding of the diagrams we discussed in class and how to code the movement within the diagrams, such as setting the reference to a new node or retrieving the data of a specific node. Additionally, I felt that I am more comfortable using getters and setters now.

What Didn't Go Well: I still feel like I am struggling to understand how to efficiently implement the methods asked of us. Going to office hours and TA hours helped me understand what code was repetitive and/or unnecessary, but I hope to be able to identify that on my own in the future. I also feel that my biggest obstacle is understanding what is being asked of me and how to go about doing that. I'm worried that the pace at which I worked on this assignment is too slow as I rushed to finish what I could despite working all week on it. I believe that my difficulty comprehending the instructions is affecting my progress and I'm not sure how to improve my comprehension as of now.

What I Will Do Differently Next Time: I was very focused on implementing the methods as quickly as I could rather than testing each of them to see how well they met the expectations, which also slowed my progress (I misunderstood what stubs wereðŸ˜…). In the future, I will definitely prioritize testing as much as I did coding.
